# Tonight
An Adroid Application made with Android Studio for my end of study project in Computer Sciences at EPHEC, Louvain-La-Neuve.
This application is about letting people create events and watch event happening in their city or close.
I tried to follow as much as possible Google Android Design Guidelines. This application is targeted at Android API >= 21.
Maybe in the futur I'll add retrocompatibility support. This is a work in progress.
